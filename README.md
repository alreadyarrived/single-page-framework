## Introduction

This framework is a client-side SPA solution that leverages modern technologies such as React, GunDB, Y.js, and Wouter to provide developers with the tools needed to build fast, scalable, and resilient web applications. It abstracts the complexity of managing state, authentication, routing, and real-time data synchronization, allowing developers to focus on delivering exceptional user experiences.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Build applications with interchangeable components and services.
- **Advanced Routing**: Dynamic route handling with middleware support.
- **State Management**: Global state management with React's `useState` and context APIs.
- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication using GunDB's SEA (Security, Encryption, Authorization).
- **Real-Time Data Sync**: Utilize Y.js and WebRTC for real-time data synchronization across clients.
- **Offline Support**: Network management with offline detection and queued operations.
- **Security**: Built-in security services for CSRF protection, rate limiting, and input sanitization.
- **Plugin System**: Extend the framework's capabilities with a robust plugin architecture.
- **Testing Framework**: Integrated testing utilities for unit and integration tests.
- **Service Worker Support**: Enhance performance and offline capabilities with service workers.

## Architecture Overview

The framework is composed of several interconnected components:

- **Core Framework**: Manages service registration and provides core functionalities.
- **Database Layer**: Uses GunDB and Y.js for data storage and synchronization.
- **Authentication Manager**: Handles user authentication and session management.
- **Router**: Manages client-side routing with support for dynamic parameters and middleware.
- **Network Manager**: Monitors network status and manages operation retries.
- **Security Service**: Provides security features like CSRF protection and rate limiting.
- **Plugin System**: Allows for the extension of the framework's capabilities through plugins.
- **Testing Framework**: Facilitates the creation and execution of tests.

## Installation

To get started with the framework, you'll need to set up a new project and install the necessary dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **npm** (version 6 or higher)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-framework-repo.git
   cd your-framework-repo
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

Here's a simple example to help you get started with the framework.

1. **Create a New Component**

   ```tsx
   // src/components/HelloWorld.tsx
   import React from 'react';

   const HelloWorld = () => {
     return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
   };

   export default HelloWorld;
   ```

2. **Register a Route**

   ```typescript
   // src/index.tsx
   import Framework from './framework';
   import HelloWorld from './components/HelloWorld';

   Framework.route('/', HelloWorld).start(document.getElementById('root')!);
   ```

3. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see your "Hello, World!" component.

## Framework Components

### Routing

The framework uses **Wouter**, a minimalist routing solution for React, to handle client-side routing.

- **Define Routes**

  ```typescript
  Framework.route('/about', AboutComponent);
  Framework.route('/user/[id]', UserComponent);
  ```

- **Dynamic Parameters**

  Use square brackets to denote dynamic segments in your routes.

- **Middleware Support**

  Attach middleware functions to routes for authentication checks or data fetching.

  ```typescript
  Framework.routeMiddleware('/dashboard', authMiddleware);
  ```

### State Management

Global state is managed using React's `useState` and Context APIs.

- **Accessing State**

  ```tsx
  const { state, setState } = useContext(AppContext);
  ```

- **Updating State**

  ```tsx
  setState({ theme: 'dark' });
  ```

### Authentication

Authentication is handled using **GunDB's SEA** (Security, Encryption, Authorization) module.

- **Create a User**

  ```typescript
  await auth.createUser('username', 'password');
  ```

- **Authenticate a User**

  ```typescript
  await auth.authenticate('username', 'password');
  ```

- **Check Authentication Status**

  ```typescript
  if (auth.isAuthenticated()) {
    // User is authenticated
  }
  ```

### Database Layer

The framework integrates **GunDB** and **Y.js** for decentralized data storage and real-time synchronization.

- **Set Data**

  ```typescript
  await db.set('key', { data: 'value' });
  ```

- **Get Data**

  ```typescript
  const data = await db.get('key');
  ```

### Network Management

Manage network status and queue operations when offline.

- **Check Network Status**

  ```typescript
  if (network.isOnline()) {
    // Online
  } else {
    // Offline
  }
  ```

- **Execute with Retry**

  ```typescript
  await network.executeWithRetry('operationKey', async () => {
    // Your operation here
  });
  ```

### Security

Built-in security features include CSRF protection, rate limiting, and input sanitization.

- **Generate CSRF Token**

  ```typescript
  const token = security.generateCSRFToken(sessionId);
  ```

- **Validate CSRF Token**

  ```typescript
  if (security.validateCSRFToken(sessionId, token)) {
    // Valid token
  }
  ```

- **Create Security Middleware**

  ```typescript
  const securityMiddleware = security.createSecurityMiddleware({
    csrf: true,
    rateLimit: { limit: 100, windowMs: 60000 },
    sanitize: true,
  });
  ```

### Plugins

Extend the framework's capabilities with plugins.

- **Register a Plugin**

  ```typescript
  Framework.use(MyPlugin);
  ```

- **Access a Plugin**

  ```typescript
  const plugin = plugins.get('MyPlugin');
  ```

### Testing

Integrated testing utilities for creating and running tests.

- **Add a Test Case**

  ```typescript
  test.add('should do something', () => {
    // Test logic here
  });
  ```

- **Run Tests**

  ```typescript
  await test.run();
  ```

## Use Cases

This framework is suitable for a wide range of web applications, including:

- **Real-Time Collaboration Tools**

  Utilize real-time data synchronization for collaborative editing or shared whiteboards.

- **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)**

  With offline support and service workers, create PWAs that function seamlessly offline.

- **Single-Page Applications**

  Build SPAs with complex state management and routing needs.

- **Decentralized Applications (dApps)**

  Leverage GunDB for decentralized data storage.

- **Educational Platforms**

  Develop interactive learning tools with real-time features.
